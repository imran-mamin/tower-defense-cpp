## Meeting 15.11.2023

### To do list:

- Update the Kanban
- Divide the tasks

Currently we have the last skeletons written in code that we made in the YML. We just changed from SDL2 to SMFL. We've been already drawing some map formats. The json isn't fully written yet. The next step, we need to connect the json into the grid class. We are a bit behind schedule.

Game class is in progress by Aleksi.

- Leevi is currently adding the code to load map and render the level background
- Valerie is doing main menu and level selection.
- Imran is working on implementing methods for the Tower class and its subclasses.

Trivial change: We plan to rename Game class to Level class as it is more suitable according to the content.
